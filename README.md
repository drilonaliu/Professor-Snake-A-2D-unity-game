This is a 2D educative game for children involing a snake eating only the right apples as an answer to the mulptiplication question. The snake has three lives, and when a wrong apple is eaten, it loses a life(a heart). A heart is lost also when the player does not eat the right apple within the time interval. The upper most right square has the multiplication question, and the one below it is the score. Each time a player eats a correct apple gets 10 points, and when it eats the wrong one, 10 points are deducted.
